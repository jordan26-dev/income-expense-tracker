I am learning python and bumped with this awsome python web application library called streamlit. 

Found a tutorial in YT about this. Coding is fun explained clearly the step by step process. You can see the tutorial video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3egaMfE9388&list=PL7QI8ORyVSCaejt2LICRQtOTwmPiwKO2n&index=12 


I recreated the app from the tutorial video and used mysql as its database as deta is no longer available to this date. 

That's it! Happy coding!
